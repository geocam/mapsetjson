This repository contains the source for the MapSetJSON Home Page, which includes
an overview, the core MapSetJSON specification, and some extensions.

Most of the content is in the reStructured Text (RST) format. To render the RST
to HTML, run ``make`` in the top directory. The results will be placed in a new
``build`` subdirectory with the same internal directory structure as the home page.

The canonical location of the home page is http://mapmixer.org/mapsetjson/ .
